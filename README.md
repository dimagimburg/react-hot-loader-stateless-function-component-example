# react-hot-loader Stateless Function Component Example
This is an example for a boilerplate that I managed to get work with the react-hot-loader v3 and one of the components is represented by a stateless function

I faced with some issues with the hot reload package when working with statless components, and after hours of struggling found a good boilerplate to get things work. Hope it helps :)

just `npm install` it and voila!

The example follows the great tutorial by rwieruch and represents the completion of the **First React Component** level here: http://www.robinwieruch.de/the-soundcloud-client-in-react-redux/#firstReactComponent
